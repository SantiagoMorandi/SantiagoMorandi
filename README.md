- 👋 Hi, I’m @SantiagoMorandi, I am in italian chemical engineer, currently finishing my PhD at ICIQ (Spain) in the Núria López group.
- 👀 I’m interested in chemical engineering, specifically in heterogeneous catalysis (DFT, microkinetic modeling), process engineering (Reactor design and process control), and Machine Learning.
- 🌱 My research focuses on the implementation of ML models (Graph neural networks and LLMs) in the field of atomistic modeling, and in the automated generation of chemical reaction networks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on chemistry- and ML-related problems!
- 📫 Contact me by sending an email to santiagomorandi@yahoo.it
